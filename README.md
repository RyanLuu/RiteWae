# RiteWae

RiteWae is a community-driven, cross-platform mobile app that helps drivers stay safe on the road. Users can report dangers they see on the road, helping others stay alert and informed.

There are plenty of navigation apps out there such as Google Maps and Waze. Alhough these apps can get you from point A to B quickly, we noticed a disturbing lack of concern for driver safety. What if we could work with these apps to prioritize safe driving and make sure users are going the RiteWae?

Our app takes navigation to the next level by ensuring your commute is on the safest route. Utilizing Google Maps API and Liberty Mutual's Shine API, our app can alert you of reported dangers or hazards nearby and provide you with historical vehicle accident data for surrounding areas.

## What's next for RiteWae

Not only do we provide safety as a service for our users, but as the app scales over time, data from the users can be used to study and improve roadway infrastructure and the driving experience for everyone. Law enforcement may use this data to prioritize problem areas. The insurance sector may use this data to have better predictors into customer behavior patterns. Urban planners can use this real world data to improve traffic. As much as RiteWae helps keep its users safe, the data collected by the users could end up keeping roads safe for everyone.

This app was built using a MongoDB Stitch backend and React Native frontend for Purdue University's 2018 hackathon, Boilermake VI.
